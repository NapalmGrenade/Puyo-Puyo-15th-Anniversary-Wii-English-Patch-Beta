# Puyo-Puyo-15th-Anniversary-Wii-English-Patch-Beta
This is an unfinished patch, but the fundamental things have been translated.
Welcome to the PP15 Wii English Patch Beta! 
This is a GRAPHICAL PATCH (since text is impossible) and works on the Dolphin GC/Wii Emulator.
This is my FIRST EVER mod on a game this big. So...
- Expect inaccurate and inconsistent things. 
- Also, expect unfinished work.
ALSO THIS IS A BETA, THE (Sort of) FULL THING IS AIMED FOR DECEMBER 15TH 2021


To make it work, go into...
WhereverYouHaveDolphinInstalled/DolphinEmulator/Load/Textures/ and extract the folder (RPUJ8P) into the textures folder.

Then, in Dolphin, go into Graphics, Advanced, and turn on "Load Custom Textures".

Any problems? Get me on Discord [ NapalmCrop || Luigi2#0416 ] or the
issues section on Github.
There also might be 2 READMEs, but it shouldn't matter.
v0.9 is aimed for the 26th November 2021.
