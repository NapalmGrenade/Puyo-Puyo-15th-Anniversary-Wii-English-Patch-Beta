# Puyo-Puyo-15th-Anniversary-Wii-English-Patch-Beta
This is an unfinished patch, but the fundamental things have been translated.
Welcome to the PP15 Wii English Patch Beta! 
This is a GRAPHICAL PATCH (since text is impossible) and works on the Dolphin GC/Wii Emulator.
This is my FIRST EVER mod on a game this big. So...
- Expect inaccurate and inconsistent things. 
- Also, expect unfinished work.

Translated most graphics, with many things untranslated. This seems inconsistent, but you'll have to do 
with it. Also, this is the last update before I start working on real hardware (that works now) next year.

To make it work, go into...
WhereverYouHaveDolphinInstalled/DolphinEmulator/Load/Textures/ and extract the folder (RPUJ8P) into the textures folder.

Then, in Dolphin, go into Graphics, Advanced, and turn on "Load Custom Textures".
